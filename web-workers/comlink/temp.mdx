is react-router a wrapper over browser history push and pop state array?

Yes, React Router is essentially a wrapper around the browser's history API, which includes methods like pushState and popState. Here's a brief explanation:
1. Browser History API: This native browser API allows manipulation of the browser's session history through methods like pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event.
React Router: It provides a more React-friendly way to handle routing in single-page applications. It abstracts the complexity of working directly with the browser's history API.
Wrapper Functionality:
React Router uses the History API under the hood to manage navigation.
It provides components like <BrowserRouter>, <Link>, and hooks like useNavigate() that internally use pushState and popState.
When you use these components/hooks, React Router updates the URL and manages the history stack without full page reloads.
4. Additional Features:
Route matching
Nested routing
Route parameters
Programmatic navigation
In essence, React Router provides a more declarative and React-centric way to work with browser history, building upon the lower-level browser History API.
